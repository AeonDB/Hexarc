ABOUT

Hexarc is an integrated software stack for implementing web applications. It includes a high-performance web server, a powerful server-
side scripting language, and a robust NoSQL database. The tight integration between these components allows for a simple and intuitive
development environment without sacrificing power or scalability.

Hexarc was developed by Kronosaur Productions to host our primary servers. The Anacreon server (https://anacreon.kronosaur.com), the 
Multiverse (https://multiverse.kronosaur.com), and the Ministry of Records (https://ministry.kronosaur.com) are all implemented on top of
Hexarc.

See: https://hexarc.com for more information.

DEVELOPMENT

Hexarc is currently being developed on Windows 10 with Visual Studio. You may use the free Visual Studio Community Edition to develop and
debug Hexarc.
